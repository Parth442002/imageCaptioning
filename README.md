# <strong>Image Captioning using Tensorflow</strong>

### CNN-LSTM Architecture based Image Caption Generator using PreTrained VGG16 model.


### [Deployement Link](https://xs-urlshortener.herokuapp.com)


## Overview
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are used for varied number of applications including machine translation. The Encoder-Decoder architecture is utilized for such settings where a varied-length input sequence is mapped to the varied-length output sequence. The same network can also be used for image captioning.

In image captioning, the core idea is to use CNN as encoder and a normal RNN as decoder. This application uses the architecture proposed by Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator.

## Implementation
This Image caption generator is developed using Tensorflow and Streamlit.
